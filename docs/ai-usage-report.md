## 🤖 AI Usage Summary

AI tools (mainly ChatGPT) were used throughout development to support learning, speed up iteration, and improve code quality.  
They were used responsibly as assistants — not for generating entire solutions — and every piece of AI-assisted code was reviewed, understood, and modified before being included in the final project.

### What AI Helped With
- Debugging and improving JavaScript features  
- Designing responsive CSS layouts and animations  
- Structuring the typing effect, theme toggle, and tab system  
- Suggesting approaches for using `localStorage` for state  
- Helping integrate external APIs (GitHub API + Quotes API)  
- Improving UI/UX details such as cards, filters, and transitions  
- Drafting documentation sections that were rewritten and refined manually  

### What I Contributed Manually
- Rewriting and simplifying AI code to fit project needs  
- Debugging deployment issues, folder structure, and API errors  
- Ensuring all logic matches course requirements  
- Refactoring JS functions for readability and performance  
- Designing, testing, and customizing all UI interactions  
- Writing the final architecture and presentation content  

### Academic Integrity
AI was used as a **learning and productivity tool**, not as a replacement for understanding.  
All final code, decisions, structure, and debugging reflect my own work, and full AI usage details are documented in:
